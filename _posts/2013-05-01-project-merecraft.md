Merecraft is a small community based around the popular game Minecraft. Besides founding the server, I helped grow the community, code custom Java plugins, and perform server maintenance.

Technologies used:
- Java
- Linux

[See some plugins on Github.](https://github.com/jmaslin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=minecraft&type=&language=)
