A simple web app that displays famous people born on a certain day.

This was created in two parts:
  1. A Wikipedia web crawler to grab famous people data. [Github](https://github.com/jmaslin/wikiCrawler)
  2. A web app to quickly display the information. [GitHub](https://github.com/jmaslin/birthday)

Read about how I developed it [here](/learning-to-crawl-the-internet/) or check it out [live](https://famousbirthday.netlify.com)!
