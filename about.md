You may be wondering how you found this website. Maybe my SEO is optimized for avocados and you are confused. Who knows.

All that matters is that you are here now! Here are some fun facts about me:

- I have had my own (personal) website since 2011 and it hasn't always looked this good*.
- I like to code! If you like that I like to code, maybe you should check out my resume.
- My favorite type of pie is Raspberry Pi.

If these facts were not fun enough for you, feel free to get in touch and let me know! I am always looking for ways to become more fun.
